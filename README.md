# 24-7 StatTrack
## 1. Global idea

In our application, we plan to track user's indicators, such as speed, mileage and geolocation
for further analysis, building interesting charts and giving advices to user, based on the collected data.
For implementation of this application we plan to use Kotlin for mobile development and NodeJS for backend.

## 2. Target audience

The application should be universal and easy to use, so everyone can use the application 
and take some advantage of it.

## 3. Team

Our team consists of three persons: Pavlo Trotsiuk, Nikita Kemarsky and Alexander Filatov. Pavlo plays a partially dual role: NodeJS Backend Developer and Kotlin Mobile Developer. Also he does code review, merge and controls the scrum process. The main NodeJS Backend Developer and Database Administrator 
is Kemarskiy Nikita. Filatov Alexander is Kotlin Developer.

## 4. Techologies

As mentioned above, we plan to use the following technologies: NodeJS for backend, PostgreSQL for
databases and Kotlin for mobile development. Why NodeJS? It is not difficult to use, it has enough
good performance and is quite cheap to design. It allows you to easily write an API. It is also very 
suitable for this type of application. Why PostgreSQL? Open-source, supported today, a lot of 
documentation, good community, easy syntax, fast. Why Kotlin? We develop only for Android, faster
writing code than on Java. We will support android versions 10+ and higher.
