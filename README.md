# 24-7 StatTrack
## 1. Global idea

In our application, we plan to track user's indicators, such as speed, mileage and geolocation
for further analysis, building interesting charts and giving advices to user, based on the collected data.
For implementation of this application we plan to use Kotlin for mobile development and NodeJS for backend.
This application is created mostly for fun and lifestyle analysis.

## 2. Target audience

Main target - curious students, who want to know more about themselves.

## 3. Team

Our team consists of three persons: Pavlo Trotsiuk, Nikita Kemarsky and Alexander Filatov. Pavlo plays a partially dual role: NodeJS Backend Developer and Kotlin Mobile Developer. Also he does code review, merge and controls the scrum process. The main NodeJS Backend Developer and Database Administrator 
is Kemarskiy Nikita. Filatov Alexander is Kotlin Developer.

## 4. Techologies

As mentioned above, we plan to use the following technologies: NodeJS for backend, PostgreSQL for
databases and Kotlin for mobile development. Why NodeJS? It is not difficult to use, it has enough
good performance and is quite cheap to design. It allows you to easily write an API. It is also very 
suitable for this type of application. Why PostgreSQL? Open-source, supported today, a lot of 
documentation, good community, easy syntax, fast. Why Kotlin? We develop only for Android, faster
writing code than on Java. We will support android versions 10+ and higher.

## 5. Prototypes

List of screens:
  1. Sign in
  2. Main screen: contains basic indicators stats, buttons to move to other screens
  3. Statistics: contains detailed indicators' statistics
  4. Charts: contains charts based on indicators' collected data
  5. Map: contains history of user movements at specific date and time
